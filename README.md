# Dominion

This is a Dominion AI in Haskell written for a class. I have [posted](http://tobin.yehle.io/articles/dominion) a detailed description of how it works on my website.

## Build

- To build the project run `$ stack build`
- To run the project run `$ stack exec dominion-exe`
- To run the tests run `$ stack test` or `$ stack build --test`
